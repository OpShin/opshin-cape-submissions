# OpShin UPLC-Cape Submissions

This repository contains submissions for the OpShin UPLC-Cape competition. Each submission is organized in its own directory, named after the submission challenge (e.g., `src/factorial`, `src/fibonacci`, etc.).

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then, run for the desired submission (e.g., `factorial` here):

```bash
make factorial
```
